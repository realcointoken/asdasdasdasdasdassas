## AWS Infrastructure

This folder contains all the code necessary to deploy a sequencer and router server to a highly-available
ecs cluster, with its required dependencies. Namely:

- Fully configured load balancing, port forwarding, and TLS
- Autoscaling with ECS on [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
- testnet/staging/mainnet environment automatic set up and deployment with GH Actions
- Reusable Infrastructure as Code, modularized as Terraform components

## Scaffolding

```text
 ├── infra           <- Cross-environment infrastructure
 ├── testnet          <- Testnet set up
 └── modules
      ├── service    <- Generic, configurable ECS service
      ├── ecs        <- ECS cluster definition
      ├── iam        <- IAM roles needed for ECS
      ├── redis      <- ElastiCache cluster
      └── networking <- VPCs, Subnets and all those shenanigans

```

## Deployment & Usage

Deployment should occur only via CICD with Github Actions. However, it is also possible to deploy the infra
from a local set up. Ensure you have the right AWS credentials and `terraform 1.1.7` installed
([instructions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)).

Grab vars from `sops` based on the `environment` you will operate on:

```shell
sops -d ops/env/testnet/backend/secrets.prod.json > ops/testnet/prod/backend/tfvars.json
```

Copy env vars from CI job:

```shell
export AWS_PROFILE=aws-deployer-connext
export TF_VAR_cartographer_image_tag=3a8dea29cf8f413e627589606f1af52c3691e5f2
```

Then, navigate to the `environment` you're targeting (e.g. `/ops/testnet/prod/backend`), and do:

```shell
terraform init
```

Make your changes, then:

```shell
terraform plan -var-file=tfvars.json
```

To set custom variables, you can set them with `export TF_ENV_<variable_name>=<variable value>`
